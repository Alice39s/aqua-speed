# Changelog

## [1.0.4] - 2025-01-16

### üí´ Added

#### Algorithm Refactoring

- ICMP, TCP, and HTTP(2) latency tests now start simultaneously to shorten the testing cycle
- Implemented dynamic buffer pool size adjustment to enhance download and upload speed testing algorithms, saving more bandwidth
- Improved upload speed testing algorithm's adaptability, now dynamically adjusting buffer pool size based on network conditions

#### CLI

- Added `--privacy` flag to support IP address desensitization
- Enhanced geographic location information display with country flag emojis
- Improved IP address display, now by default hiding /24 and /48 segments of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses

#### Logging and Debugging

- Enhanced logging to provide more detailed speed testing process information
- Optimized error handling and retry mechanisms
- Supported more flexible progress callback functions

### üîß Changed

#### Dependency Management

- Added new dependencies:
  - `@types/cli-progress`: CLI progress bar type definitions
  - `ip-address`: IP address processing tool
  - `cli-progress`: Command-line progress bar component

#### Partial Type Refactoring
